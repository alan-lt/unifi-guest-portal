Requires
----------------------------------------
PHP >= 5.5.0
UniFi >= 4.6.0

Ubiquiti UniFi External Portal Example
----------------------------------------
The provided example of authorizing guests on the UniFi controller had 
some minor issues. First and for most was the the fact that it relied 
on an external script. This is a deal breaker for users that are on 
cheap shared hosting that has functions PHP's exec disabled for 
security purposes. It also is not a good idea to call out to external 
scripts from the internet at large due to the security implications. 
This is a pure PHP solution and just requires that the curl module is 
installed for PHP.

Original code from https://github.com/kaptk2/portal
-----------------------------------------
There are two examples included.
  * Simple is most basic form, this can be used as a jumping off point
    to making your own more complex portal.
  * SQL contains a way to store uses in an external database using
    sqlite. It is written using PDO so switching database types is
    trivial.

AdminLTE design and Google LDAP integration
-----------------------------------------
  * Code in early POC stage (no time for rework)
  * Solution work from 2020 in organisation with 1k users (Google Workspace)
  * Post about why I start this project https://blog.alan.lt/2021/02/first-look-on-unifi-wireless-access.html#more
